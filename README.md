# Lung Cancer Detection System using CNN

This project implements a deep learning-based system for detecting lung cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The core logic and experimentation are provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- End-to-end workflow for lung cancer image classification
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model design, training, and evaluation
- Visualizations of training progress and predictions

## File Structure

- `Lung_Cancer_Prediction_System_Fixed.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations for the lung cancer detection system.

## Requirements

- Python (recommended: 3.7+)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Deep learning libraries: TensorFlow or Keras (as used in the notebook)
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib for data handling and visualization

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vikas2430/Lung-Cancer-detection-System-using-CNN.git
   cd Lung-Cancer-detection-System-using-CNN
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Lung_Cancer_Prediction_System_Fixed.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the cells sequentially**
   - Follow the explanations and code cells in the notebook to preprocess data, build the CNN model, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset

Please refer to the notebook for details on the dataset used for lung cancer detection. You may need to download medical imaging datasets such as CT scans from publicly available sources (e.g., Kaggle, NIH).

## Results

The notebook provides training accuracy, validation accuracy, and example predictions to assess model performance.
